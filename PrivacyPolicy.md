**Effective Date:** October 31, 2025

**Last Updated:** October 31, 2025

## 1. Introduction

RaveSociety ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application **Closed Captioner** (the "App"). Please read this privacy policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal data and how we treat it.

By downloading, installing, accessing, or using our App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use our App.

## 2. Information We Collect

Closed Captioner is designed with privacy in mind. We collect and process the following types of information:

### 2.1 Audio Data (Microphone Input)
- **What we collect:** Audio recordings from your device's microphone when you use the speech-to-text feature
- **How we collect it:** Through your device's microphone with your explicit permission via iOS permission prompts
- **Why we collect it:** To provide real-time speech-to-text transcription functionality
- **How we use it:** Audio is processed locally on your device using Apple's Speech Recognition framework to convert speech to text. Audio data is **NOT** stored, saved, or transmitted anywhere - it is processed in real-time and immediately discarded after transcription

### 2.2 Transcribed Text Data
- **What we collect:** Text transcriptions of your speech, including any edits you make
- **How we collect it:** When you use the speech-to-text feature or manually enter/edit text
- **Why we collect it:** To display captions and provide app functionality
- **How we use it:** Text is stored locally on your device in UserDefaults for:
  - Display as on-screen captions
  - Caption history (optional feature)
  - Export functionality (text, PDF, HTML formats)

### 2.3 Caption History
- **What we collect:** Previous caption entries with timestamps
- **How we collect it:** Automatically when you create captions (if caption contains 2+ words)

### 2.4 Device Motion Data
- **What we collect:** Accelerometer data when using the shake gesture feature
- **How we collect it:** Through your device's motion sensors (CoreMotion framework)
- **Why we collect it:** To detect shake gestures for the pickup lines feature

- **How we collect it:** Automatically through app functionality
